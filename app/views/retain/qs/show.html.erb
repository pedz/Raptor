    <ol>
      <li>
	Hover over PMR number to see Customer's name, Comments,
	Customer's time of day, and ECPAAT.
      </li>
      <li>
	Each section of ECPAAT is limited to first 5 lines.
      </li>
      <li>
	Time of last CT can be seen by hovering over Next CT.
      </li>
      <li>
	Hover over red or orange fields to see cause of error or
	warning.
      </li>
      <li>
	Text of buttons can be typed into text box for mouseless
        navigation e.g. <q>202</q> will go to a call with PPG of 202
        if there is one.  <q>home</q> goes to home page.
      </li>
      <li>
	Click on Customer's name to invoke email to customer.
      </li>
      <li>
	Click on Comments (what most call the <q>title</q>) to alter
	them.
      </li>
      <li>
	Click on Owner, Resolver, and Next Queue to alter them.  Owner
	and Next Queue are not alterable for WT PMRs.
      </li>
      <li>
	PMR colored in orange is under <q>initial contact</q> criteria.
      </li>
      <li>
	PMR colored red is <q>system down</q> criteria.
      </li>
      <li>
	To get to a specific PMR, you can edit the URL in the
	browser's address bar.  The address will be (e.g.)<br/>
	<%= combined_pmrs_url("12345,ABC,XYZ").sub('.', '/') %><br/>
	This also works for PMHs.
      </li>
      <li>
	As above, you can go to a particular queue directly by editing
	the URL.  You will note that there is an extra <q>S</q> in the
	URL.  e.g. PEDZ,165 comes out as PEDZ,S,165.  The <q>S</q> is for
	<q>software</q>.  Thus, you can view hardware queues by using an
	<q>H</q>.  For example, IOPE,H,021.
      </li>
      <li>
	To requeue a PMR over to hardware, simply requeue it to the
	properly specified hardware queue e.g. IOPE,H,021.  The one
	catch is that you can not log PSAR time when you do this.  The
	PSAR is added after the requeue but PMHs do not have PSAR,
	they have something else.  So, add your time before the
	requeue (e.g. with an addtxt) and you'll be fine.
      </li>
      <li>
	Button names on the left are the call's PPG.  The 4-tuple of
	queue,s_or_h,center,ppg uniquely specifies a call in Retain.
      </li>
      <li>
	PAT customers show up with a white background under their
	name.
      </li>
    </ol>
