  The database threw a &ldquo;duplicate key&rdquo; exception.  Usually this
  happens when two users are updating the same record (like a PMR) at
  the same time.  Note that most fetches from Retain cause a database
  update so even if you are just reading a queue, it can cause the
  database to be updated.

  Retry what you just did and see if it goes away.  If it persists,
  make sure its not your fault.  For example, adding the same favorite
  queue again will cause this exception.  If all else fails, let me
  know.
