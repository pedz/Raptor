The Customer_list.txt and crit-sit-pmrs.txt are updated via external
processes.

Currently Customer_list.txt is copied from GSA via a cron job on p51
over to the tcp237 server.  Another cron job on tcp237 parses the file
and sets the :pat flag for the PAT customers.  I've been told that the
Customer_list.txt file is edited directly by hand when it changes.

Currently the crit-sit-pmrs.txt is updated by a process from Newtoy
(my laptop).  I am sent an excel file each week from the crit sit
team.  It is parsed by a Ruby 1.8 program into the crit-sit-pmrs.txt
and I run the add_crits rake task from my laptop which sets the crit
sit name into the field in the PMRs if the field is blank.
