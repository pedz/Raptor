    <ol style='width: 40em;'>
      <li>
	Verify EPCAAT and flag if not complete.  Probably color the
	&ldquo;link-etc&rdquo; area red in the QS page and the EPCAAT
	button on the call page red.
      </li>
      <li>
	Add User profiles as a pre-cursor to user settable options
      </li>
      <li>
	Add the concept of teams.  Associated with that concept are
	users that are members of teams as well as queues that are the
	teams' incoming queues.  This is a pre-cursor to creating team
	specific processes.
      </li>
      <li>
	Add journal entries for any significant activity such as
	updates, requeues, etc.  Journal will be viewable by the
	user.
      </li>
      <li>
	The PMR itself needs a title attribute to indicate why it is
	colored the way it is.  I'm not sure where to put this.
      </li>
      <li>
	Make the favorites list sortable via drag and drop.
      </li>
      <li>
	The darkened color of a PMR is not correct.  It should key off
	the owner of the queue the call is on, if any.  Not the
	owner of the call itself.
      </li>
      <li>
	I don't like the new title used for calls.
      </li>
      <li>
	Delete the call on the QS page if it gets deleted or requeued.
      </li>
      <li>
	PMR list is the list of favorites if on a team queue.
	Eventually it should be the list of team members.
      </li>
